Worked on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Other than this I have used in Jquery in enquiry.html page and portfolio.html page.
The major implementation of JavaScript is performed in enquiry.html.
Use of CSS can be seen in all the three html pages of this repository.
All the three pages are interlinked with each other by opening any one of the page you can navigate to other two pages.
In Navbar by clicking on contact you can navigate to portfolio.html page.
In Navbar by clicking on Signup you can navigate to Enquiry.html.
In Navbar by clicking on Home you can navigate to demo1.html.
There is a styling.css which is a seprate CSS file for portfolio.html
